I chose to use a dictionary data structure for my recipe entries because they are mutable and it supports key value pair entries and nested dictionaries which are required for this task. Dictionaries are better suited or this type of data structure than a list or tuple.

I chose a list for my outer structure for two reasons. Firstly, becuase it is sequencial which was a requirement of the task and secondly because it is a mutable structure as opposed to a tuple.
